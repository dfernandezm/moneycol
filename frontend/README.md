# MoneyCol Frontend

This is the frontend of the system. Written in React, Typescript, Graphql and `create-react-app`.

## Run locally without backend

Just run `npm start`. That would start the Webpack dev server, but the GraphQL queries won't work. Use it for styling and static development.

## Run locally with backend

###Â Elasticsearch
* Unzip the `data.zip` folder in a known location in your machine


* Start the backend server (more details in [server startup](https://github.com/dfernandezm/moneycol/server/README.md))
```
$ cd server
$ ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT_WITH_PORT=localhost:9200 npm run start:dev
```

* Open file `src/index.tsx` and change `uri` to `localhost:4000/graphql`. Reload browser and server calls should work.

* Setting up Apollo with Typescript in React example: https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/tree/master/examples/typescript
* Use Apollo Client directly in event handlers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55890604/how-to-implement-search-function-in-react-graphql-using-react-hooks-and-apollo-c

### Making GQL calls with Apollo Client instead of `useQuery`

```
// From inside a component controlled by ApolloProvider


const client = useApolloClient();
...
const performSearchCallWithApolloClient = async (client: ApolloClient<object>) => {
  console.log("Making call to GQL using apollo client");
    const { data } = await client.query({
    query: GQL_QUERY,
     variables: { searchTerm: usableSearchTerm },
  });
}
```
